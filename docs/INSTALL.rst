Installation
============

Installation using Conda
------------------------

The easiest way to install SMURFF is to use
`Conda <https://conda.io>`__:

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c vanderaa smurff

From source on Linux or MacOs
-----------------------------

Building using cmake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before continuing installation please check that

  - cmake version is at least 3.6
  - eigen3 version 3.3.3 or later is installed.

This is required due to the fixed Find scripts for BLAS libraries that
are present in latest version.

Next, cmake has multiple switches:

- Build type switches:
   - CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE - Debug/Release

- Algebra library switches (select only one):
    - When no switches are specified, CMake will try to find
      any LAPACK and BLAS library on your system.
    - ENABLE\_OPENBLAS - ON/OFF (should include openblas
      library when linking. openblas also contains
      implementation of lapack called relapack)
    - ENABLE\_MKL - ON/OFF: tries to find the `MKL single dynamic
      library <https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-linux-developer-guide-using-the-single-dynamic-library>`_.

Run CMake:

.. code:: bash

    # install dependencies:
    sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev autoconf gfortran

    # checkout and install Smurff
    git clone https://github.com/ExaScience/smurff.git
    cd smurff/cpp/
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../cmake -DENABLE_OPENBLAS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    make
    make test

    # test the command-line program:
    wget http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~jsimm/chembl-IC50-346targets.mm
    Debug/smurff --train chembl-IC50-346targets.mm

The last command running smurff will be very slow, since we have compiled
smurff in Debug mode.

Install command line smurff and Python package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install:

.. code:: bash

    make install
    cd python/Smurff
    python setup.py install


Test scripts for python are in `smurff/python/smurff/tests`.
When the python package has been installed correctly, you can
run `python -m unittest discover` in this directory.


From source on Windows
----------------------

Before continuing installation please check that
 - cmake version is at least 3.6
 - Visual Studio version is 2013 or better 2015 because code
   uses some c++11 features

Install boost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download latest version of boost from http://www.boost.org/

Start Visual Studio command prompt and execute the following commands.

::

    bootstrap.bat
    b2 toolset=msvc-14.0 address-model=64 --build-type=complete stage

This will compile and install boost libraries into build directory.

If you have Visual Studio different from 2015 - select proper toolset.

Configure boost environment variables as in the example:

::

    BOOST_INCLUDEDIR=E:\boost_1_65_0
    BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=E:\boost_1_65_0\stage\lib

Install eigen3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the following commands from command prompt:

::

    git clone https://github.com/RLovelett/eigen.git
    cd eigen
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../ -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"

If you have Visual Studio different from 2015 - select proper generator.

Build INSTALL target in Visual Studio in Release configuration.

This will build all projects and install them in Program Files by
default.

Configure eigen3 environment variables as in the example:

::

    SMURFF_INCLUDE_DIRS=C:\Program Files\Eigen3\include\eigen3

Install MinGW-64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MinGW-64 is required to build OpenBLAS library. MinGW-64 is chosen
because it is easy to install fortran compiler dependency. Fortran
compiler is requried for building ReLAPACK part of OpenBLAS. Other
option (not described here) is to install fortran compiler directly.
There are few binary distributions described here:
http://fortranhelp.blogspot.ru/2010/09/i-have-just-installed-gfortran-on.html

Download installer at http://www.msys2.org/

Configure msys2 exactly as described in the guide.

Install corresponding packages with pacman

::

    pacman -S gcc
    pacman -S gcc-fortran
    pacman -S make
    pacman -S autoconf
    pacman -S automake

Add path to MinGW-64 binaries to PATH variable as in the example:

::

    C:\msys64\usr\bin

Install OpenBLAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open MinGW-64 command prompt

Execute the following commands:

::

    git clone https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git
    cd OpenBLAS
    make
    make PREFIX=/e/openblas_install_64 install

You can change installation prefix if you want.

Set environment variables as in the example:

::

    BLAS_INCLUDES=E:\openblas_install_64\include
    BLAS_LIBRARIES=E:\openblas_install_64\lib\libopenblas.dll.a

Add path to OpenBLAS binaries as in the example:

::

    E:\openblas_install_64\bin

Install Smurff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the following commands from command prompt:

::

    git clone https://github.com/ExaScience/smurff.git
    cd smurff\lib\smurff-cpp\cmake
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../ -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DENABLE_OPENBLAS=ON -DENABLE_VERBOSE_COMPILER_LOG=ON

If you have Visual Studio different from 2015 - select proper generator.

Build INSTALL target in Visual Studio in Release configuration.

This will build all projects and install them in Program Files by
default.
